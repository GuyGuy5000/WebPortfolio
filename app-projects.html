              Lorem Ipsum is simply <b>dummy text</b> of the printing and
              typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
              dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
              <b>unknown printer</b> took a galley of type and scrambled it to
              make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
              centuries, but also the leap into <b>electronic</b> typesetting,
              remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
              with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
              passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
              Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

              Emma's small engines was a <b>collaborative</b> school project
              build to be employee facing and used to streamline customer orders
              and repairs. Created with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and
              <b>JavaScript</b>. Made using <b>agile methodology</b>, this
              project was completed in <b>three sprints</b>. Throughout these
              sprints, my role was to <b>lead communications</b> and
              <b>coordinated team members</b>. Additionally I coded whole pages,
              custom dropdowns, and context help using the mentioned programming
              languages to ensure <b>W3C guidelines</b> were followed.
